# Optimization of Distribution Model

In this project, the main objective was to optimize the cost of milk transportation from a distribution center. 
To achieve this, an optimization model was developed using advanced Excel techniques. The model incorporated 
factors such as transportation routes, distances, quantities of milk, and associated costs.

To begin, data related to transportation routes, distances, and milk quantities were collected and organized in 
Excel. Using advanced Excel features, such as formulas, macros, and data analysis tools, we constructed the 
optimization model. Sensitivity analysis was performed to understand the impact of changing variables on 
transportation costs.

Additionally, one-way and two-way analyses were conducted to evaluate the sensitivity of the model to different 
parameters and identify optimal solutions. By leveraging these techniques, we were able to optimize the 
distribution process by minimizing transportation costs while ensuring efficient milk delivery from the 
distribution center to the desired locations.
